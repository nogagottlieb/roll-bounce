# RollBounce
RollBounce read a property file and creates a linked list of balls with the properties in the file.
The program moves the balls on the screen using properties of gravity and friction. The ball changes its y and x coordinates using the x and y velocity. I used 4 different conditions to check if the ball need to bounce (one of the "walls"), and change the velocity of x and y by that.
